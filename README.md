A comprehensive multi-service demo application showcasing microservices architecture with New Relic monitoring integration, deployed on Kubernetes.

## 🏗️ Architecture

This demo consists of three main services:

### Applications
- **🔧 .NET Core Web API** (`application/dotnet/`)
  - RESTful API with user management
  - Entity Framework Core with PostgreSQL
  - Health checks and error handling
  - New Relic APM integration

- **🐍 Python Application** (`application/python/`)
  - Python web service with AI/ML capabilities
  - New Relic AI monitoring for ML model performance
  - APM integration with custom AI metrics tracking
  - Containerized with Docker

- **⚛️ React Frontend** (`application/react-crud-app/`)
  - CRUD operations interface
  - User management UI
  - Browser monitoring with New Relic
  - Built with modern React

### Infrastructure
- **📊 Monitoring**: New Relic APM, Browser, and AI monitoring
- **🤖 AI Observability**: ML model performance and inference monitoring
- **🗄️ Database**: PostgreSQL with Helm deployment
- **☸️ Orchestration**: Kubernetes (K3s) cluster
- **🐳 Containerization**: Docker containers for all services


## 📋 Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- Kubernetes cluster (K3s recommended)
- Helm 3.x
- .NET 8 SDK (for local development)
- Node.js 16+ (for local development)
- Python 3.9+ (for local development)

**Tested Platforms:**
- Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
- Windows 11
- macOS Monterey

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/LocTaRND/newrelic-ai-monitoring-demo.git
cd newrelic-ai-monitoring-demo
```

### 2. Set Up K3s Cluster
```bash
cd k3s-setup
chmod +x setup-k3s.sh
./setup-k3s.sh
```

### 3. Deploy PostgreSQL
```bash
cd ../postgresql
chmod +x deploy-postgresql-helm.sh
./deploy-postgresql-helm.sh
```

### 4. Build and Push docker applications image into Docker registry
```bash
# Create your secrets based on the template
cd ../application
chmod +x script.sh
./script.sh
```


### 5. Configure Secrets
```bash
# Create your secrets based on the template
cd ..
cp deployment/secrets/secrets.yaml.template deployment/secrets/secrets.yaml
# Then update the secrets into the secrets.yaml file
# Edit the secrets file with your actual values
```

⚠️ **Never commit `secrets.yaml` to version control. Rotate secrets regularly and follow your organization's security policies.**

### 6. Deploy Applications
```bash
cd deployment
chmod +x script.sh
./script.sh apply force # for run the first time or if you want to always deploy
```

## 🛠️ Local Development

### .NET API
```bash
cd application/dotnet
dotnet restore
dotnet run
```

### Python App
```bash
cd application/python
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

### React Frontend
```bash
cd application/react-crud-app
npm install
npm start
```


## 📊 Monitoring

This demo includes comprehensive monitoring with New Relic:

- **APM Monitoring**: Backend services instrumentation
- **AI Monitoring**: Python app includes New Relic AI monitoring for:
  - ML model performance tracking
  - Inference latency and throughput metrics
  - Model accuracy and drift detection
  - Custom AI/ML application metrics
- **Browser Monitoring**: Frontend performance tracking
- **Infrastructure Monitoring**: Kubernetes cluster metrics
- **Custom Dashboards**: Pre-configured monitoring views


Access your New Relic dashboard to view real-time metrics and performance data.

**Useful Links:**
- [New Relic Documentation](https://docs.newrelic.com/)
- [K3s Documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/k3s/latest/en/)
- [Helm Documentation](https://helm.sh/docs/)


## 🔐 Security

- All sensitive configuration is stored in Kubernetes secrets
- Secret files are excluded from version control via `.gitignore`
- Follow principle of least privilege for service accounts
- Regular security updates recommended
- Use network policies and RBAC for Kubernetes security
- Keep Docker images and dependencies up to date
## 🛡️ Troubleshooting

- **K3s service not starting:**
  - Run `sudo systemctl status k3s` and check logs with `sudo journalctl -u k3s -f`.
- **New Relic agent not reporting:**
  - Ensure your license key is correct and network access to New Relic endpoints is allowed.
- **Docker build errors:**
  - Check Docker daemon status and available disk space.
- **Helm install issues:**
  - Run `helm list` and `helm status <release>` for more info.

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: How do I get a New Relic license key?**
A: Sign up at [New Relic](https://newrelic.com/) and find your key in the account settings.

**Q: How do I reset the K3s cluster?**
A: Use the scripts in `k3s-setup/` or follow the K3s documentation for cluster reset.

**Q: How do I update secrets?**
A: Edit `deployment/secrets/secrets.yaml` and re-apply with `kubectl apply -f deployment/secrets/secrets.yaml`.

**Q: Where can I find more documentation?**
A: See the links in the Monitoring section above.
