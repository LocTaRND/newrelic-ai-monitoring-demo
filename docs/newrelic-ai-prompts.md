## üí° Tips for Better Results

1. **Include relevant tags and labels** in your queries
2. **Reference specific time periods** when issues occurred
3. **Mention the business impact** of issues
4. **Ask for comparative analysis** (before/after, different environments)
5. **Request specific metrics** rather than general overviews
6. **Follow up** on recommendations with implementation questions
