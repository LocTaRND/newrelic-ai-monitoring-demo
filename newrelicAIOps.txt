To understand the "intelligence-engine" in the context of New Relic, consider the following aspects:

Response Intelligence with New Relic AI: New Relic AI integrates with the Issue page to provide real-time insights, helping reduce the mean time to resolution (MTTR) of issues. It consolidates incident details into a single view, offering a concise summary of affected entities, issue severity, and alert conditions. This integration aids in quick understanding and resolution of issues. Learn more about Response Intelligence with New Relic AI.

Causal Analysis Engine: This engine identifies potential symptoms that might trigger alerts and suggests mitigating actions. It analyzes various categories like deployment events and infrastructure resource limits to pinpoint anomalies and performance issues. Currently, it supports causal analysis for APM entities. More details can be found in the New Relic documentation.

New Relic AI Preview: This preview offers capabilities like translating plain language into NRQL queries, synthesizing how-to guides, and providing insights for root cause analysis. It is part of an early access program for eligible customers. For more information, visit the New Relic AI Preview page.

These features collectively enhance the observability and management of incidents, leveraging AI to streamline and improve the resolution process.
